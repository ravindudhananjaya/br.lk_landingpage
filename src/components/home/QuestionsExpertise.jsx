    question: "How much time you are going to take to finish my order?",
    answer:
      "Premium orders have a processing speed 3 times faster than Basic orders. We typically form companies within just 2 days. Securing the EIN takes an additional 3â€“5 days (Note: Most other providers require at least 2 weeks for EIN acquisition).",

For UK companies, we also require a registered office address (which we can provide). All documents can be submitted digitally through our secure portal.",
